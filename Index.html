<h4>Welcome to Dominika's Kitchen</h4>
<p> Our goal at Dominika's Kitchen is to give you quick and easy to follow recipes. You don't need to have a lot of experience to follow the recipes just the right attitute. We try to cater to everyone's preferences and or needs.#
We will try to provide recipes for people who are gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, or have any allergies no matter how rare; there's replacements or ammendments that can be made to suit your needs.</br>
</br>
The idea behind this has started due to the fact that I suffer with severe citrus allergies and unfortunately lemons and limes are often added to foods without being mentioned. In restaurants or in ready made meals a lot of the time it won't
disclose that there is lemons or limes in there. This has forced me to find food replacements where possible and search and try different things to figure out what can add a similiar flavour or do the same jobs. 
Like guacamole, every guacamole recipe includes lemon juice, through trial and error I have figured out that apple cider vinegar can do the same without the allergic reactions after. I always give my all to try and 
find the perfect replacement. This is why there is a submission/request page for other people out there who want to eat certain dishes but can't due to allergies or just preferences. I will give my all and try out
all possible options to find you the closest replacement. </br>
</br>
I am here to help make it easier for you to cook for yourself, instead of ordering take aways and to show you that cooking can be fun. You will feel great about your body too, you'll find if you eat healthy and cook
at home you will feel so much better within yourself. No more feeling slugish, no more struggling to get out bed because of a lack of energy. So give it a try and notice the difference yourself.
